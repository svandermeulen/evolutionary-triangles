In short, the algorithm's objective is to take an input image and try to draw a representation of it using only triangles.
This is achieved by applying a genetic approach, where in each generation a set of predefined number of individuals are mutated and crossbred to generate individuals for the next generation.
Each individual is an image with equal dimensionality as the input image on which a predefined number of triangles are drawn.
For the initial generation these triangles are drawn by randomly generating their respective coordinates and RGBA colors.
All individuals are then compared with the input image by measuring the mean squared Euclidean distance between each pixel representing a fitness score.
