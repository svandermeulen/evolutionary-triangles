In short, the algorithm's objective is to take an input image and to try to draw a close representation using only triangles, also referred to as triangulation.
This is achieved by applying a genetic approach, where a set of predefined number of individuals are mutated and crossbred to create new generations, of which only those with the highest fitness are kept.
The main sequence of operations is:
<ul>
	<li>Generate individuals.
	<li>Compute the fitness of each of the individuals, 
	<li>Crossbreed pairs of individuals, slightly favoring individuals with higher fitness scores. 
	<li>Mutate the outcoming children
	<li>Only keep the top n of the population based on their fitness scores for the next generation
	<li>Repeat above steps for m number of generations
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<h4>Generate individuals</h4>
An individual is represented by an image of equal size as the input image, on which a predefined number of triangles are drawn.
The drawing is performed by one of the following two methods:
<ul>
<li>overlapping 
<li>non-overlapping
</ul>
For the overlapping method, each triangle is represented by the coordinates of its three corners as well as its RGBA color together represented by a set of 10 randomly generated integers.
For the non-overlapping method, the given number of triangles defines, the number of random points drawn within the space of the input image.
These points act as the vertices that are connected to form edges following the Delaunay algorithm. 
As a consequence, the final number of triangles is unpredictable but is never very far off from the input number of triangles.
The coordinate integers are limited by the dimensions of the input image and the RGBA integers can range between 0-255.

<h4>Fitness, crossbreeding, mutation and selection</h4>
<p>
Once the predefined number of individuals are created, each individual is compared with the input image by taking the mean of the squared Euclidean distance between all respective pixels.
This metric is taken as the fitness of each individual.
</p>
<p>
After the fitness computation, pairs of individuals are selected for crossbreeding, either by Tournament selection or Biased Random selection.
During crossbreeding, the genes of two individuals are mixed to obtain two new individuals with different phenotypes.
The genes in this case are represented by the coordinates and the RGBA values of the triangles.
For the overlapping method, the coordinates are given by three sets of x, y integers representing the corners of each triangle. 
And for the non-overlapping method these coordinates are the vertices of Delaunay points.
The crossover method is randomly picked from the following three implemented methods: one-point, two-point or uniform crossover and there is also a predefined probability that no crossover happens. 
</p>
<p>
Next, the outcoming children are undergoing mutations, during which the values in a gene have a predefined probability to be changed to a random integer.
Once all the original individuals plus the newly formed children are sorted according to their fitness scores and the top n is selected to go to the next generation.
Here n is equal to the predefined population size.
</p>
<p>
The above steps are repeated until the maximum given number of generations have been reached.

<h4>Example</h4>
An example of a run using the overlapping method, 1000 generations, 100 individuals per generation, 25 triangles per individual, a mutation rate of 5% and a crossover rate of 95%.
